### Please download the latest version of MSRefine in the release area on the right.
OpenSpec is an integrated computational workflow specifically designed for Astral-DIA data analysis. The pipeline performs spectral deconvolution of DIA data to generate DDA-like pseudo-MS/MS spectra, which are subsequently processed using open-search DDA engines to comprehensively identify and characterize unexpected modifications. This approach significantly enhances the depth of DIA data interpretation.
